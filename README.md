## Task - To Explore Supervised Machine Learning

In this regression task we predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables.

Data can be found at http://bit.ly/w-data

We answer the question - "What will be the predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs in a day?"
